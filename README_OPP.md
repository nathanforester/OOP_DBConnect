### PYODBC AND OOP

- We are looking into the PYODBC package
- We are going to use the package to make a new OOP module that abstracts our interaction with the NW DB
- Then further abstracts the interaction with specific tables
- Where appropriate, we will use the CRUD design to build methods
- Need to add further abstraction that abstracts interaction with specific tables
## CRUD
- Create
- Read (READ 1: by ID, READ ALL: based on all results/params)
- Update
- Delete
